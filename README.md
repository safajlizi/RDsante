Our project was carried out within the National School of Engineers of Carthage for 5 weeks. We chose our mini project which consists of developing a patient management application in a clinic.                                          
The goal of my project is to design and implement a simple application for computerizing medical files and managing the affairs of patients and staff in the clinic.

The main objectives of the hospital are:
- Maintaining patient admission records.
- Keeping patient care a top priority.
- Schedule the patient's appointment with the doctor (consultant) to facilitate the matter for both.
- Storing clear details of patient's diseases, diagnosis and management for research comprehensive.
